# GradeClassification  
A project where me and ArcticStorm9 classified data using different machine learning models to determine which is the best for simple data. We used a decision tree, neural network, and support vector machine to classify a simple data set of math class student performance. The full writeup can be found [here](https://github.com/DGStatic/GradeClassification/blob/main/writeups/GradeClassification.pdf).
